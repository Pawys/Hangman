# Hangman
This project is a simple command-line version of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. It offers an enjoyable and interactive experience for users to challenge themselves with word puzzles.

This project is based on the Hangman Assignment from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
